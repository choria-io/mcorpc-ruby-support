# Choria MCollective RPC Ruby Support Libraries

These are stripped down versions of the legacy MCollective libraries that
are used to facilitate hosting Ruby based MCollective Agents within the
Golang daemon as well as interact with a Choria network from the Ruby API

It's not possible to run the old MCollective daemon using this code or the
resulting gem.
